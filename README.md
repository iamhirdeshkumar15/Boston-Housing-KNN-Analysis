# Boston-Housing-KNN-Analysis
This repository demonstrates the use of the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to predict housing prices based on the Boston Housing dataset. The dataset is preprocessed, normalized, and split into training and testing sets. The KNN model is trained on the features, and accuracy is evaluated using a confusion matrix.
